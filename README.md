# Natours: Tour Management and Booking Platform

## Description
This project is a comprehensive web application designed for a company organizing tours. It enables users to browse, manage, and interact with tour listings, with functionality tailored for different user roles. The platform ensures secure access to data and operations, leveraging robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Features

- **Tour Listings**:
  - Displays a catalog of tours with details such as price, duration, and other attributes.
  
- **User Roles**:
  - Different user roles (e.g., normal users and organizers) with distinct access levels.
  - Normal users can browse tours but cannot modify information.
  - Organizers have access to manage and update tour details via the backend.

- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
  - Role-based access control to protect sensitive operations (e.g., modifying tour information).

- **Login System**:
  - Users can log in using a username and password.
  - User account information stored securely in a MongoDB database with defined schemas.

- **Email Notifications**:
  - Integrated email-sending functionality using Nodemailer for user communication.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js for server-side logic and API implementation.
  - Express.js for routing and middleware.

- **Database**:
  - MongoDB for data storage.
  - Mongoose for schema definition and database interaction.

- **Authentication**:
  - JWT for secure token-based authentication.

- **Email**:
  - Nodemailer for sending emails.

## API Endpoints

- **Tours**:
  - `GET /api/tours` - Retrieve all tours.
  - `POST /api/tours` - Add a new tour (Organizer only).
  - `PUT /api/tours/:id` - Update tour details (Organizer only).
  - `DELETE /api/tours/:id` - Delete a tour (Organizer only).

- **Authentication**:
  - `POST /api/auth/login` - User login.
  - `POST /api/auth/signup` - User registration.

## Security Measures

- Token-based authentication with JWT ensures only authorized users can perform protected actions.
- Role-based access control ensures organizers have exclusive permissions for managing tours.
- Sensitive data like passwords are encrypted before storage.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement payment integration for tour bookings.
- Add a user-friendly front-end interface.
- Enable real-time notifications for tour updates.
